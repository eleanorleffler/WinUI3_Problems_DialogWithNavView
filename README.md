# WinUI3_Problems_DialogWithNavView

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating a NavigationView inside a ContentDialog in both UWP and WinUI3 Desktop.

The UWP sample code does not break and works as expected. 

However, the WinUI3 Desktop sample code breaks when opening the ContentDialog.
